A modified version of https://github.com/Ultimaker/Ultimaker2Marlin configured to work with DMv2 3D Printer.

This firmware does not store information about how much has been printed and how long the printer has been in operation for. If this
is important then maybe this firmware is not for you.

You will need to make a note of all you EEPROM settings for your current configuration, this firmware has a bare-bones configuration
for proper operation once you have uploaded the firmware you will need to modify the EEPROM parameter prior to printing.

Machine profiles for a DMv2 with Heated bed are provided - for both Repetier-Host and Cura.

*Known Issues*
LCD Panel control does not work and is currently disabled.
